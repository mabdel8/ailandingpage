        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: March 5, 2023</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to AI Scanner. Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully before using the AI Scanner mobile application (the "App") operated by AI Scanner ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
        
        <p>By downloading, accessing, or using our App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, then you do not have permission to access or use our App.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using our App, you confirm that you are at least 13 years of age or older, and that you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the App on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms, and you agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of that organization.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
        
        <p>By continuing to access or use our App after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the App.</p>
        
        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide accurate, complete, and current information at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our App.</p>
        
        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password you use to access the App and for any activities or actions under your password. We encourage you to use strong passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols) with your account.</p>
        
        <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
        
        <h2>4. User Content</h2>
        <p>Our App allows you to upload, submit, store, send, and receive content, including homework problems, images, and other materials ("User Content"). You retain any rights to your User Content that you had prior to uploading it to our App.</p>
        
        <p>By uploading User Content to our App, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content in connection with providing the App and its features to you and other users.</p>
        
        <p>You represent and warrant that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You own or have the necessary rights to use and authorize us to use all intellectual property rights in and to any User Content;</li>
            <li>The User Content does not violate any intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other rights of any person or entity;</li>
            <li>The User Content complies with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We reserve the right to remove any User Content from the App at any time, for any reason, without notice.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the App:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In any way that violates any applicable national, federal, state, local, or international law or regulation;</li>
            <li>To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material, including any "junk mail," "chain letter," "spam," or any other similar solicitation;</li>
            <li>To impersonate or attempt to impersonate AI Scanner, an AI Scanner employee, another user, or any other person or entity;</li>
            <li>To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the App, or which, as determined by us, may harm AI Scanner or users of the App, or expose them to liability;</li>
            <li>To use the App to cheat on exams, tests, or assessments where the use of external assistance is expressly prohibited;</li>
            <li>To interfere with the proper working of the App, including uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other malicious code.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Educational Use and Academic Integrity</h2>
        <p>AI Scanner is designed as an educational tool to help you understand and learn from homework problems. We encourage responsible use of our App in accordance with your school's or institution's academic integrity policies.</p>
        
        <p>While our App can provide solutions and explanations for homework problems, we strongly encourage you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App as a learning aid, not as a substitute for your own work and understanding;</li>
            <li>Properly cite or reference any solutions provided by our App if you incorporate them into your work, as required by your institution's policies;</li>
            <li>Consult with your teachers or instructors if you're unsure about the appropriate use of our App for specific assignments.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>AI Scanner is not responsible for any academic dishonesty or violations of academic integrity policies that may result from misuse of our App.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <p>Subscriptions automatically renew for the same subscription term unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period. You can cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting our customer support team.</p>
        
        <p>All payments are processed through third-party payment processors. By providing your payment information, you agree to allow us and our third-party payment processors to charge the specified amount for your subscription.</p>
        
        <p>Prices for our subscriptions may change upon notice from us. Such notice may be sent to you via email or posted on the App. If you do not agree to the price change, you have the right to reject the change by canceling your subscription before the price change goes into effect.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>
        
        <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the App, or contact us to request account deletion.</p>
        
        <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

        <p>whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
